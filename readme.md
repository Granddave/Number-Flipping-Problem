# Math problem

So, I got this math problem from my father:

There is a number written on a seven-segment display that has five digits. There are not two digits that are the same. The display now rotates 180 degrees so that the number is upside down. The number that shows right now is 67 025 bigger than the real number.

What is the real number?
